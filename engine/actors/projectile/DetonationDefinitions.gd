		# TO DO: we could include scene [sub]path/name here, or we can add `@export detonation_type: DetonationType.GRENADE_EXPLOSION` to the detonation scene's base script and set the mapping there (requires attaching to a scene); probably best to use scene name, minus ".tscn" here and construct the full path to the scene when loading it (once we convert)
