# important:

# WiH is scaled down and moved completely inside Body radius close to camera to prevent clipping through walls
#
# for now, WIH (assets) are attached directly to Player (engine) so they initialize and connect to Weapons when level is entered; this also allows them to be positioned in-camera in the 3D view; eventually, they should attach programatically to avoid asset->engine coupling

# TO DO: Boomer (Pfhor ship) maps have a low gravity flag, but I assume we can get the same effect by loading a different physics model for those levels? (really don't want lots of flag modifiers)



# TO DO: in 3D Physics layers, rename "Level" to Map/MapGeometry/Wall/Surface/Solid/Exterior/Architecture/Shell or something else that's descriptive as "Level" is unhelpful (in mapping terms, a Level is the map geometry *and* all of the objects inside it)

# TO DO: Player currently uses CapsuleShape to detect floor; at what point does capsule slide off a ledge? (not sure what M2's collision cylinder does - it might remain on ledge as long as any part of its base remains in contact; capsule is useful as it can push player out from wall so the model doesn't appear to slide down wall partly embedded in it; we might want to add a smaller cylinder to bottom of capsule to widen it a bit; also need to decide on player's Projectile/Explosion hit box, which may be a slightly narrower capsule or cylinder; there is also Player-NPC collisions to consider, which may need a wider collision cylinder to prevent NPC models' extremities appearing embedded in Player when both bodies are very close/touching)


# TO DO: player speed when running up/down ramps should be similar/same to player speed running up/down stairs, which should be similar to Classic player on stairs (if up and down ramp speeds are the same, SeparationRayShape3D at bottom of player body can provide that; not sure how that will behave around stairs though)

#
# once a collision is initially detected, we'll want some way of determining if it's a climbable step, jumpable ledge, smooth ramp (doesn't need special handling), or non-climable (e.g. it's too small/shallow/steeply sloped to stand on, e.g. wall greebles are ignored but greeble-like structures in the Level layer will be detected); for now, use a single raycast while getting the basic implementation working
