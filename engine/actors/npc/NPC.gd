# TO DO: whether we have a single general-purpose NPC class or multiple subclasses for some (e.g. flying) or all NPC types is TBD; for now, code an all-in-one NPC class (which is how Classic M2 does it) and if it becomes unwieldy then refactor into subclasses according to behavioral category (flying vs walking vs swimming) as that's probably the biggest behavioral difference 
#
# (note: do not model friendly/neutral/hostile behaviors as subclasses: that behavior will be specified with flags same as in Classic as NPC allegiances need to change in some levels, and Bobs and beserkers can be either)


# for now, don't bother setting up audio: we'll define an NPCAudio class so different awake, walk/run footstep, jump, land, shoot primary/secondary, hit, die, etc, etc sounds can be defined for each SpeciesType; an NPCAudio instance can then be bound to the NPC and its animations which then call the NPCAudio's awake, chatter, footstep, shoot, etc methods to play a sound 

# as a stretch goal, unique sounds may also be defined directly on an NPC subclass or its animations, e.g. Bobs might have some unique behaviors such as randomly chatting to each another when two Bobs are standing close together with no hostiles nearby, but standard sounds should all go behind the NPCAudio class's standard API as we need to get that fully functioning before we start considering any stretch goal enhancements
