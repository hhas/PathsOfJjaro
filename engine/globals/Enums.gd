# note: these use M3 Physics values (adapting properties as needed); M1-only definitions can be added once the data structures are finalized; any discrepancies between M1 and M2, use the M2 definitions


# note: use enums for MRC development (with same names and int values as Classic M2 files, caveat M1-only objects which should be added to enums after the M2 names) as that gives us typechecking
#
# if/when we add 3rd-party modding support, these enums can be changed to ints (TypeIDs), trading GDScript safety for extensibility; similarly, the definition tables can be recreated as external JSONs; the JSONs can also contain dictionaries containing the int-string mappings; a high-level WAD editor can perform consistency checks to ensure JSONs are correctly formed and don't contain any invalid type IDs (but until we develop those authoring tools, GDScript's static typechecker is the most robust option we have, though it's weak on arrays and can't validate dictionary structures)

	# LAVA_LAMP_BREAKING,

	# ALIEN_LAMP_BREAKING,
	
	# TO DO: what about breakable/unbreakable glass/props? if we can keep breakables simple - e.g. small glass prop, large glass prop, glass window - we might get away with a few generic breaking-glass animations; it depends on the complexity of the asset, and whether it's a full scene with standard API and custom implementation, or if we can have a single general-purpose scene [for each Family] with standard implementation and only Species/Object-specific animations are different? table-driven is preferred as it reduces code and facilitates high-level modding tools (including GUI table editor and table validator - it is easy to check for missing relationships, provide defaults)
	
	METAL_RICOCHET, # general richochet effect; TO DO: should all impacts have a default fallback, e.g. if a bullet travelling in air hits something metallic which doesn't define a specific bullet-from-air-into-metal, play a generic METAL_RICHOCHET visual? 
	#
	# also, can we simplify the transition tables so they only need to declare general transitions from media to flesh/armor/glass/etc, with the exact visual effect determined by crossreferencing the impactees's Species (or Family), e.g. bullet + HUMAN + flesh = red, bullet + PFHOR + flesh = yellow; bullet + HUMAN + armor = bright sharp metal-on-metal spark; bullet + PFHOR + armor = dull splattery metal-on-ceramic spark; this would work more like CSS, with a basic "one-size-fits-all" definition which can be inherited and some properties overridden
	#
	# note: However we structure the final static definition tables, our runtime object graph will contain a complete, ready-to-use BodyDefinition instance for every kind of body that exists in the game world. i.e. We only use table lookups when loading the scenario; we don't want expensive dictionary lookups constantly performed throughout gameplay. So we only need to get the DEFINITION structures' design "good enough" that they can be used to instantiate all the Definition objects we need for Arrival's actors. By the time we've built that, we'll have a better idea how to structure the final DEFINITION tables so adding new definitions is logical and [reasonably] easy.
