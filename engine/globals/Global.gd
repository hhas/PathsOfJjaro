# Global.gd

# global state should, as a rule, go here; e.g. if Player instance persists between levels, store it in a property here and pass it to a newly instantiated Level scene when configuring that level's state; alternatively, mapmakers can position a new Player node in each map (which is probably preferable for mapmakers) and Global holds the player's level-independent state (health, inventory)


# TO DO: for function naming convention, use single leading underscore for Godot event handlers (_ready, _on_area_foo_entered), use double underscores for private functions and vars; do NOT use leading underscores on public properies and methods

# TO DO:  it's possible for weapon activating animation to be reversed if the user presses previous/next_weapon key multiple times (repeatedly pressing the key quickly will step over weapons without activating any except the last-selected weapon, but pressing it a bit more slowly may cause a weapon's activating animation to start playing without allowing time for it to finish; ideally there should be a single animation that can be played either forward or backward or slowed/paused at any point so it's trivially reversible, otherwise we'll have to interpolate the model between 2 different positions, which may or may not produce a satisfactory animation)




# health status signals

signal oxygen_changed() # while oxygen/shield increment/decrement could be reported as health_changed, it doesn't really simplify things (since it needs an DamageType.OXYGEN constant added and listeners must implement an extra conditional test to handle it; plus shield hits probably want to take the original DamageType enum so it can display different screen effects for different types of impact)
signal health_changed(damage_type: Enums.DamageType) # M2 calls health "shields" (unlike DOOM, M2 doesn't have separate health plus optional ablative armor which reduces health damage), but since it is running out of health which kills you we use DOOM-style nomenclature in code
signal player_died(damage_type: Enums.DamageType)

func _ready():
